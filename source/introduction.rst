Introduction to Polymer
=======================

The Polymer project is a toolkit designed to assist in the generation and
analysis of polymer structures.
This project includes tools for generating both amorphous and crystalline
structures for polymers like isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and polyethylene (PE).

The aim of this project is to provide users with the ability to:

- Generate polymer structures with varying configurations in LAMMPS-formatted file.
- Compute various properties of the generated polymers from LAMMPS-formatted results.
- Utilize common functions across different polymer generation tasks.

This documentation will guide you through the various components of the Polymer
project, providing detailed information on each tool and how to use them effectively.

Explore the documentation to understand the different aspects of polymer generation
and property computation available within this toolkit.
