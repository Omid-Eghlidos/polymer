# Polymer
This repository includes two sets of programs as follows:
    * Generation: Generating initial systems of different phases of semicrystalline polymers, e.g., amorphous and crystal
    * Properties: Computing different properties of polymers

## Generation
Comprises set of programs for generating different phases of semicrystalline polymers. The following systems have been implemented so far:
1) Polyethylene (PE):
    * Amorphous: Generate amorphous phase of PE using self-avoiding random walk of the given number of chains and number of monomers.
    * Crystal: Generate crystal phase of PE with orthorhombic unit cell with the given number of repetition along its primitive axes of a, b, and c.
2) Polypropylene (PP):
    * Amorphous: Generate amorphous phase of PP using self-avoiding random walk of the given number of chains and number of monomers.
    * Crystal: Generate alpha (monoclinic unit cell) and beta (orthorhombic unit cell) modifications of the PP with the given number of repetition along its primitive axes of a, b, and c.

## Properties
Comprises a set of programs that based on the property that they are computing, are classified into the following categories:

1) Dynamics
2) Kinmeatics
3) Kinetics
4) Mechanical
5) Physical
6) Structural
